# Uncommon Expo CLI Android Build/Runtime Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI to build and run Android apps. The error is characterized by vague error messages and can manifest in several ways, including a blank screen on the device/emulator, app crashes during runtime, or failures during the build process itself.

## Problem Description

The specific error message may vary, but the core issue is a problem during the build or execution of the Android application, often leaving developers without clear guidance for troubleshooting. This is particularly problematic because the error messages from Expo are not always informative.  The root cause could range from dependency conflicts to incorrect Android SDK setup.

## Solution

The solution to this type of error is usually found through a systematic process of elimination: 

1. **Verify Android Setup:** Ensure the Android SDK is correctly installed and configured.
2. **Check Dependencies:** Review the package.json file to identify and resolve any potential dependency conflicts.  Try running `expo prebuild` to resolve issues. 
3. **Clean the Build:**  Remove old builds and caches (`expo start --clear`)
4. **Check Manifest:** Examine the AndroidManifest.xml file for any potential errors or missing permissions.
5. **Examine Logcat (Android Studio):**  Use Logcat in Android Studio to identify more detailed error messages. 
6. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** Consider reinstalling the Expo CLI in case of corruption.
7. **Update dependencies:** Updating your expo and other relevant packages to their latest versions can sometimes solve the issue.

## How to Reproduce

The exact steps to reproduce this error are not consistent, as the underlying cause varies. However, the provided `bug.js` attempts to demonstrate a scenario that might trigger this type of issue, although in practice the problem often occurs without obvious code issues.
